Key Technologies:
Framework: Flutter
State Management: GetX is used for state management, dependency injection, and navigation.
Mapping: google_maps_flutter is used to display maps, user location markers, and routes.
Location Services: geolocator is used to get the device's current GPS coordinates.
Backend: firebase_database (Firebase Realtime Database) serves as the backend to store and sync location data between users in real-time.
Application Flow & Features
The application has three main screens, each with a dedicated controller for its logic:

Home Page (HomePage)

Purpose: This is the main screen that displays a list of registered users.
Functionality: It fetches user data (likely from Firebase), allows searching/filtering through the user list, and shows each user's ID and creation time.
Navigation:
Tapping on a user in the list navigates to the LocationTracker page to view that user's route.
Tapping the floating action button navigates to the ShareLocationPageMapView for the current user to start sharing their own location.
Share Location Page (ShareLocationPageMapView)

Purpose: This screen allows the current user to broadcast their location.
Functionality:
It requests location permissions and gets the user's current position.
It displays the user's location on a Google Map with a marker.
It starts a location stream that continuously listens for position changes.
With every update, it pushes the new coordinates (lat, long) and a timestamp to the Firebase Realtime Database under the path /users/{currentUserUid}/location.
Show Route Page (LocationTracker)

Purpose: This screen is for tracking another user's location in real-time.
Functionality:
It takes the uid of the target user to track.
It gets the current user's live location.
It listens for real-time updates of the target user's latest location from Firebase.
It displays both the current user and the target user on the map with markers.
It draws a Polyline (a blue line) between the two users to visualize the direct route or distance.
The map camera automatically adjusts to keep both users in view.
Architectural Highlights
Clean Architecture: You've done a great job separating the UI (View) from the business logic (Controller) using the GetX pattern.
State Management: The use of a ViewState enum (loading, complete, error) is excellent practice. It makes the UI robust by allowing you to easily show a loading spinner or an error message while data is being fetched.
Real-time Sync: The use of Firebase Realtime Database streams is the core of your app, enabling the live tracking feature to work seamlessly.
